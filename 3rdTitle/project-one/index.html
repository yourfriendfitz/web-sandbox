        The Warriors have achieved 57 wins so far this season. They have been
        red hot since March. They also have been relatively healthy, although
        Steph Curry suffered a mild sprain on Tuesday night against the New
        Orleans Pelicans.

        The warriors would end up losing to the Toronto Raptors in Game 6 of the
        NBA Finals. Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant both suffered major injuries
        in the NBA Finals.
