      The Warriors have achieved 57 wins so far this season. They have been red hot since March.
      They also have been relatively healthy, although Steph Curry suffered a mild sprain on Tuesday night
      against the New Orleans Pelicans.

      The dubs will have a tough time in the playoffs if Curry is not 100% healthy. We can expect
      Steve Kerr to play Quinn Cook in the First Round later this month to keep Curry as healthy
      as possible.
